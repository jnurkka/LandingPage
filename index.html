        <p class="body">We make nursing better! We are building a next-gen operating system for care operations that helps reduce workload on nurses in stationary care settings like hospitals and nursing homes. It automates communication and improves the delegation of tasks based on qualification and availability. This way we contribute to reducing the effects of the global personnel shortage in patient care. I am responsible for designing and building the system together with my team as well as HR and recruiting.</p>
